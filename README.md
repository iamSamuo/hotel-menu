# hotel-menu
A simple web project that displays different items in a hotel menu. The functionalities have been enabled using JavaScript
I iterated through an array of data composed of diffrent images and displayed the content to the browser using JavaScript. 
I also used a filter methode to display diffrence images for different categories.
Here is the link to the actual project. https://samuocodes-hotel-menu.netlify.app/
